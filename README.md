# Express, Pug, Node.js Portfolio Site

This application uses Node.js, the back-end framework Express, and Pug Templating to create a fully-functional portfolio website.  Users can read descriptions, view photos, 
and check out live links to a number of my previous JavaScript/Web Design projects.  The "about" page contains a short bio, and links to contact me, view my code on github, connect with 
me on LinkedIn, and provides a direct download to my resume.   

To run this application, first run npm install in the console.  Then, type "npm start" or "nodemon" into the console to run the app on PORT 3000.  You can view the app in your browser by visiting http://localhost:3000 or visit the live site at http://jlayher-portfolio.herokuapp.com
