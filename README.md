# JS-Project-6
 Static Node.js and Express Site
-John Layher

I am hoping to meet the requirements for "Exceeds Expectations" and would prefer to have my project rejected if my current work does not meet the requirements.

I don't wish to currently link to any of my personal profiles for Twitter or LinkedIn, nor do I wish to publish my phone# or email at this time.  I asked
one of my Support Specialists on Slack about this, and I was told it would be fine to put placeholder information for the contact section of the "/about" page
and that I should link to the home pages of Twitter and LinkedIn, instead of linking to my personal accounts.  




Style Changes:
    - The following style changes are located at the bottom of the style.css file
        .return-link
            changes display type to 'block', and changes both the text and background color of the anchor ('Back To The Home Page!') button, in both error.pug and page-not-found.pug
        .stack
            decreases the text size, sets the display to 'block', and adds slight margins to the stack text on the span elements in both error.pug and page-not-found.pug
        .err-title-margins
            applies slight left and right margins to the h2, h5, and h6 elements in both error.pug and page-not-found.pug
        .light-shadows
            used to apply a light text-shadow to the h1 element, displaying my name, on the home page
